# StudentDB
Attempts at making a student system, in both console and front-end formats
StudentDB-v1 is console-based, built with multithreading manually and JDBC.
StudentDB-v2 has an HTML front-end, built with Servlets and jsp.
StudentDB-v3 also has a front-end, built with Spring and Thymeleaf.

You can test by first deploying the student database with the initial schema via docker:

```bash
docker compose-up
```

Then testing the chosen implementation in your chosed IDE (preferably IntelliJ Idea). v2 and v3 are to be tested with Tomcat.
